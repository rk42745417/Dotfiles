I have installed but I don't know if it is necessary:  
[rofi themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)  
[polybar themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes)
[polybar spotify](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify)

## Run the install script
It should be `$ ./install.sh` but I'm too lazy to write it for now.

## Misc
`:Plug Install` in vim  
`$ zplug install`
